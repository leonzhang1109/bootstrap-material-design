Hi Leon,

I found this package on Atmosphere at https://atmospherejs.com/leonzhang1109/bootstrap-material-design

It looks identical to the original package you forked it from.

Have you added any features that justify publishing this clone of the package on Atmosphere?

If it was a mistake, you can easily correct it by running

    meteor admin set-unmigrated leonzhang1109:bootstrap-material-design
 
Thank you,
Dan
